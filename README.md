# Concordia Travel Web Application

## Project Description
The Concordia Travel Web Application is designed to provide a comprehensive travel booking system that enables customers to browse and book travel packages, including flights, hotels, and activities. Customers can create custom packages by selecting individual components that suit their travel preferences.

## Business Model
Concordia Travel offers various travel packages to customers, which may include:
- Flights
- Hotels
- Activities (e.g., guided tours, food experiences, excursions)

### Key Features:

- **Account Management**: Customers can create accounts, view their bookings, and manage (modify or cancel) their reservations.
- **Agent Management**: Agents can create and manage packages and bookings, view reports on bookings, and handle customer requests.

## Process Flow
1. **Browse Packages**: Customers browse available travel packages and individual components (flights, hotels, activities).
2. **Select Package**: Customers choose either a pre-made package or create a custom package.
3. **Cost Calculation**: The system calculates the total cost, including all components and additional fees.
4. **Confirm Booking**: Customers confirm their booking and submit payment information.
